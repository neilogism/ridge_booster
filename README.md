# Ridge Booster: Adaptive Tree Reweighting for Gradient Boosting

## Overview

Ridge Booster is a novel gradient boosting variant that uses ridge regression to adaptively determine optimal tree weights in ensemble models. Unlike traditional gradient boosting methods that rely on fixed learning rates or greedy weight updates, this approach solves for a globally optimal set of tree contributions, potentially reducing hyperparameter sensitivity and manual tuning requirements.

## Problem Statement

Traditional gradient boosting applies fixed learning rates to all ensemble members, requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. While the gradient indicates the direction for model improvement, determining the optimal step size (tree weight) remains a manual process that can significantly impact model performance and training efficiency.

## Solution Approach

### Mathematical Formulation

At iteration T, the model prediction is:
$$y^{(T)} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \omega_t f_t(x)$$

Instead of using fixed weights, Ridge Booster solves the regularized optimization problem:
$$L(\omega) = || y - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \omega_t f_t(x)||^2 + \lambda ||\omega||^2$$

The optimal weights are found via:
$$\omega = (F^{\top}F + \lambda I)^{-1}F^{\top}y$$

where $$F \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times T}$$
### Implementation Variants

**Closed-form Ridge Solution**: Direct matrix inversion for exact optimization
**Greedy Reweighting**: Independent weight optimization using scipy.optimize.minimize  
**Conjugate Gradient Approximation**: Numerically stable alternative using iterative CG solver

## Key Results

- **Reduced hyperparameter sensitivity**: Ridge variants showed less sensitivity to hyperparameter selection compared to traditional methods
- **Comparable accuracy**: Best-case performance matches traditional gradient boosting while requiring less manual tuning
- **Improved stability**: Adaptive reweighting provides inherent regularization, particularly beneficial on noisy datasets
- **Faster convergence**: Demonstrated accelerated learning curves on synthetic datasets with high noise variance

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy
- **Evaluation**: Custom benchmarking framework comparing multiple boosting variants
- **Datasets**: Synthetic regression data (sklearn.make_regression) and California Housing dataset

## Limitations

- **Computational complexity**: Matrix operations scale as O(T²) in memory and O(T³) in computation, limiting practical use to ensembles with <500 trees
- **Regression only**: Current formulation applies to regression problems; extension to classification requires modified loss functions
- **Numerical stability**: Closed-form solution sensitive to ill-conditioned matrices (mitigated by CG variant)

## Applications

This methodology could benefit:
- **Automated ML pipelines** where hyperparameter tuning overhead is expensive
- **Resource-constrained environments** where manual tuning isn't feasible
- **Research applications** exploring adaptive ensemble methods


## Installation & Usage

```python
from ridge_boosting import RidgeBooster

# Initialize model
model = RidgeBooster(method='conjugate_gradient', reg_lambda=0.1)

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Future Directions

- Extension to classification tasks using logistic loss functions
- Online/incremental learning variants for streaming data
- Integration with modern boosting frameworks (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Theoretical convergence analysis for CG approximation
