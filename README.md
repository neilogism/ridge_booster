# Ridge Booster: Adaptive Tree Reweighting for Gradient Boosting

## Overview

Ridge Booster is a novel gradient boosting variant that uses ridge regression to adaptively determine optimal tree weights in ensemble models. Unlike traditional gradient boosting methods that rely on fixed learning rates or greedy weight updates, this approach solves for a globally optimal set of tree contributions, potentially reducing hyperparameter sensitivity and manual tuning requirements.

## Problem Statement

Traditional gradient boosting applies fixed learning rates to all ensemble members, requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. While the gradient indicates the direction for model improvement, determining the optimal step size (tree weight) remains a manual process that can significantly impact model performance and training efficiency.

## Solution Approach

### Traditional Gradient Boosting Background

Traditional gradient boosting builds an ensemble sequentially by fitting each new tree to the residuals of the previous ensemble. At iteration $t$, the process follows:

1. **Compute residuals**: $r_i = y_i - F_{t-1}(x_i)$ where $F_{t-1}$ is the current ensemble
2. **Fit weak learner**: Train tree $h_t(x)$ to predict residuals $r_i$
3. **Update ensemble**: $F_t(x) = F_{t-1}(x) + \eta \cdot h_t(x)$

The learning rate $\eta$ is typically fixed (e.g., 0.1) and chosen through manual hyperparameter tuning. This approach treats each tree's contribution as predetermined by the learning rate, regardless of the tree's actual predictive value.

### Ridge Booster Mathematical Formulation

Ridge Booster departs from this fixed-weight approach by solving for optimal tree contributions globally. At iteration T, the model prediction is:
$y^{(T)} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \omega_t f_t(x)$

Instead of using fixed weights, Ridge Booster solves the regularized optimization problem:
$L(\omega) = \| y - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \omega_t f_t(x)\|^2 + \lambda \|\omega\|^2$

The optimal weights are found via:
$\omega = (F^{\top}F + \lambda I)^{-1}F^{\top}y$

where $F \in \mathcal{R}^{N \times T}$ is the matrix of tree predictions.

### Implementation Variants

**Closed-form Ridge Solution**: Direct matrix inversion for exact optimization
**Greedy Reweighting**: Independent weight optimization using scipy.optimize.minimize  
**Conjugate Gradient Approximation**: Numerically stable alternative using iterative CG solver

## Key Findings

- **Reduced hyperparameter sensitivity**: Ridge variants (purple/orange lines) show flatter validation curves compared to Fixed LR, indicating less sensitivity to hyperparameter selection
- **Comparable best-case accuracy**: Ridge CG achieves MSE of 0.287 vs Fixed LR's 0.270 on California housing, demonstrating competitive performance
- **Improved convergence**: Ridge variants show faster initial learning on synthetic data, reaching lower MSE in fewer iterations
- **Numerical stability**: Conjugate Gradient variant maintains performance while avoiding matrix inversion instabilities
- **Training efficiency**: Ridge methods achieve comparable training times (1.17-1.32s) to traditional approaches while requiring less hyperparameter tuning

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy
- **Evaluation**: Custom benchmarking framework comparing multiple boosting variants
- **Datasets**: Synthetic regression data (sklearn.make_regression) and California Housing dataset

## Limitations

- **Computational complexity**: Matrix operations scale as O(T²) in memory and O(T³) in computation, limiting practical use to ensembles with <500 trees
- **Regression only**: Current formulation applies to regression problems; extension to classification requires modified loss functions
- **Numerical stability**: Closed-form solution sensitive to ill-conditioned matrices (mitigated by CG variant)

## Applications

This methodology could benefit:
- **Automated ML pipelines** where hyperparameter tuning overhead is expensive
- **Resource-constrained environments** where manual tuning isn't feasible
- **Research applications** exploring adaptive ensemble methods
